### Constraints
Some of the constraints on the size of the Ark:
  - Human Physiological Requirements
    - What is the maximum speed of rotation that the Ark must keep below?
  - Human Psychological Requirements
    - What size provides an equivalent experience to mobility on Earth? 
      How large does the Ark need to be to attract people to the voyage?
  - Energy To Move Required Matter
    - What is a completely infeasible scale for Ark?
      What is possible now, 50 years, 100 years?
