The foot of the mission is the urge to preserve the existence of consciousness
in the universe. At the time of writing there is no physical theory which can
predict which organizations of matter conduct conciousness and which do not.
However, for those of us who do experience it, it seems quite special.

Because consciousness is still an open scientific question, there are many
ways to approach the topic. I will give you my reasoning which starts internally
and works externally.

> I am as sure of anything, as I am that I am consciouss
This is Descartes. Primed with this, it stands to reason that other humans
sharing a similar brain structure to me would also be conscious (though they
