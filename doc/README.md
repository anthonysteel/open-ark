### Documentation
Please hyperlink to the resource if possible and optionally a short description.
If it is not accessible by a public link, give the link for page by the publisher
(in the case of a paper) or Wikipedia link (for a book). Don't upload raw PDF's
as they clog the repository. If a link becomes broken but is on the archive, link to
the archive and push the change.
