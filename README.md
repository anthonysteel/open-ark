# Open-Ark
Design of a massive ark to transport people through interstellar
space, the open source way.

Talk of interstellar travel is often centered around finding a hapitable planet
in another solar system, travelling there at relativistic speed and then
either returning or signalling for a subset of humanity to follow.

Open Ark's design philosophy is different, we believe in bringing a slice of
a habitable planet with us, instead of looking for it in the stars.

There are many humans that would leave Earth for many reasons, and I do not want
to try and speculate what they are or will be. It is up to each person to decide
whether they would go or not. If you need to be pitched to be on the Ark, you
probably shouldn't be on the Ark.

### Motivations
  - The urge to preserve the existence of consciousness in the universe.
  - Achieve the greatest scientific and engineering accomplishment of all time.
  - The excitement of exploration and adventure beyond our wildest dreams.

### Bringing A Sun
The complexity of life required to create an Earth-like environment requires
bringing a fusion reactor to act as a psuedo-sun.

### Fast vs. Slow Interstellar Travel
By fast I mean relativistic and denote the velocity v_f, and slow
non-relativistic and denote the velocity v_s.
[Constant acceleration drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_travel_using_constant_acceleration)
have been proposed as a method for acheiving fast interstellar travel. The
interest in travelling fast is usually motivated by wanting to return to Earth.
This thinking is pointless, because there is no meaningful reason to return to
Earth. The distance is so large that there could be no meaningful communication
between Earth and the Ark besides a stream of what happened 4.3 years ago.
If the Ark was to try and return to Earth, the time dilation would be severe
(check the time dilation for different fast Ark velocities).

The amount of energy required for the trip is proportional to the square of the
velocity, and linear with the mass. This means that for the same amount of
total energy, the mass of the ship (by extension its size) will decrease with
the square of the factor relating v_f to v_s.  The size of the ship is more
important than its velocity if habitability is supreme.

- `docs` Compiling documentation and resources about Ark related technologies
and sciences.
- `scripts` Python scripts for back of the envelope calculations.
